# Backline

**Keep your people together.** Backline is the toolkit behind a Discord community: a bot and a dashboard that welcome new members, keep moderation honest, give members a private place to ask for help, and let your server run its own events, levels, feeds and radio. Switch on only what your server needs. Everything else stays off.

[CI on Gitea](https://git.subcult.tv/subculture-collective/backline/actions)

Backline is a SUBCULT tool. It is a release candidate in a **private pilot** with the SUBCULT community. Public installation is not open yet; the pilot is where setup, permissions and real-server behavior get checked before a wider release. Source of record: [git.subcult.tv/subculture-collective/backline](https://git.subcult.tv/subculture-collective/backline).

## Why Backline

Most community bots hand you a hundred commands and a config file. Backline hands you **jobs**.

- **A good first hello.** Welcome messages, a rules gate, and roles members pick for themselves.
- **Keep the context.** Warnings, timeouts, kicks, bans and purges land in a case history with a reason and the staff member who acted. Delivery is confirmed against current Discord permissions, never assumed.
- **Make room to listen.** Private tickets that the opener, invited participants, configured staff and server administrators can see. Transcripts expire on the schedule you choose.
- **Your server, your rules.** Every module is opt-in per server, configured from the dashboard or `/settings` in Discord, and starts disabled.
- **Nothing silent.** Moderation and settings changes are durable jobs with a state you can read back. Recovery snapshots are owner-confirmed before anything is restored.

## 23 modules, five groups

| Group                   | Modules                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Welcome and community   | Onboarding, self-assigned roles, birthdays, AFK status, suggestions, polls, community reports                              |
| Safety and records      | Moderation, anti-spam, audit log, private tickets, activity reports                                                        |
| Engagement              | Leveling, giveaways, economy, entertainment, audio (approved SomaFM stations, clips and soundboards)                       |
| Automation and recovery | Scheduled utilities, custom commands, Twitch/YouTube/RSS integrations, workflows, recovery snapshots and selective restore |
| Operator extensions     | Plugins installed by the bot operator                                                                                      |

Each module has a developer note under [`docs/developer/`](./docs/developer/), for example [onboarding](./docs/developer/onboarding.md), [moderation](./docs/developer/moderation.md), [tickets](./docs/developer/tickets.md) and [recovery](./docs/developer/selective-restore.md). The [bot expansion roadmap](./docs/developer/bot-expansion-roadmap.md) records what is built, what is planned, and the qualification gate for each.

## The dashboard

Sign in with Discord and Backline shows the servers where you hold Manage Server permission.

- **Overview**: what is switched on, what is waiting on the operator, moderation actions still in flight, API service state, and the newest cases.
- **Server setup**: the module catalog, grouped as above, with search, state filters and collapsible settings per module.
- **Moderation**: queue an action, follow its delivery, and read the case table.
- **Activity, analytics and metrics**: observed member activity, channel heatmaps, suspicion and ghost scores, network and flow diagrams, and usage metrics. Activity collection is a module the server enables; nothing is collected until it does.
- **Status**: database, cache and Discord API availability.

It ships in light and dark mode, honors reduced-motion preferences, and is built on a documented [design system](./docs/design/APP-SYSTEM.md) that carries the [Backline identity](./docs/design/BACKLINE.md).

## Tech stack

- **Bot and API**: Node.js 22, Express, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL behind PgBouncer, Redis

## Quick start

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your Discord credentials and secrets
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

- Dashboard: http://localhost:5173
- API: http://localhost:3001
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5432

See [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md) for the full setup.

### Manual

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npm run dev          # Discord bot and job worker
npm run dev:api      # API server

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Running `npm install` in the repository root installs the Git hooks (ESLint and Prettier on staged files, type checks before push, conventional commit messages).

## Configuration

The backend validates its environment with [Zod](https://zod.dev/) on startup and exits with code 1 if anything required is missing or malformed.

### Backend (`backend/.env`)

Generate secrets with:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Modules that need privileged Discord intents (member, message content, voice state) also need those intents enabled on the bot by the operator. The dashboard marks such modules "Needs operator" until that is done.

### Frontend (`frontend/.env`)

| `VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`     | Discord OAuth2 client ID                       | Yes                |
| `VITE_ENVIRONMENT`           | Environment label                              | No (`development`) |
| `VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS`      | Dashboard usage analytics                      | No (`false`)       |
| `VITE_ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID` | Analytics tracking ID                          | No                 |

Frontend variables are embedded in the build and visible to every visitor. Never put a secret in one.

## Testing

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm test                  # all tests
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:coverage

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm test                  # unit and component tests (vitest)
npm run test:e2e          # Playwright
npm run test:coverage
```

Frontend tests run under jsdom with a storage polyfill for current Node releases. See [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) for the test layout and [docs/developer/release-qualification.md](./docs/developer/release-qualification.md) for what a release has to pass.

## CI and releases

Gitea is the source of record. Its action-compatible workflows run backend, frontend, database and image checks for pull requests and reviewed revisions. The GitHub mirror and the legacy GitHub/AWS workflows are not a release path.

The supported release topology is [compose.release.yml](./compose.release.yml): PostgreSQL, Redis, one migration barrier, one API, one bot and job worker, and the compiled dashboard. Deployments are operator-controlled. Select immutable image digests from the reviewed revision, run the migration barrier, and verify the bot heartbeat, API readiness and dashboard health. [Deploy a Backline release](./DEPLOYMENT.md) covers the procedure, backup and disposable restore verification.

`docker-compose.prod.yml`, `deploy.yml` and `deploy-production.yml` describe legacy paths and are not current deployment instructions.

## API, SDK and plugins

The API is guild-scoped: `/api/guilds`, `/api/guilds/:guildId/modules`, `/api/guilds/:guildId/moderation/cases`, `/api/guilds/:guildId/jobs/:jobId` and per-module routes for history, diagnostics and actions. Moderation actions take an idempotency key, so a lost response can be retried safely.

- **Swagger UI**: `/api/docs` · **ReDoc**: `/api/redoc` · **OpenAPI 3.0**: `/api/openapi.json`
- [Public API reference](./docs/PUBLIC_API.md), [developer guide](./docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md), [authentication](./docs/api/AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md), [rate limiting](./docs/api/RATE_LIMITING_GUIDE.md)
- The public API uses API keys with tier-based quotas (FREE, PRO, ENTERPRISE) and per-endpoint rate limits.

```bash
npm install @spywatcher/sdk
```

```typescript
import { Spywatcher } from '@spywatcher/sdk';

const client = new Spywatcher({
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3001/api',
    apiKey: 'spy_live_your_api_key_here',
});
const ghosts = await client.analytics.getGhosts();
```

Plugins extend the bot and API without touching core code: dynamic loading, a permission system, event hooks, custom routes and lifecycle management through `/api/plugins`. Start from [`backend/plugins/template`](./backend/plugins/template/) and read the [plugin system guide](./PLUGIN_SYSTEM.md).

## Operations

- **Security**: multi-layer rate limiting, request validation, IP blocking and load shedding with circuit breakers. [RATE_LIMITING.md](./RATE_LIMITING.md), [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PgBouncer transaction pooling and Prisma. [CONNECTION_POOLING.md](./CONNECTION_POOLING.md), [POSTGRESQL.md](./POSTGRESQL.md), [DATABASE_OPTIMIZATION.md](./DATABASE_OPTIMIZATION.md)
- **Backup and recovery**: scheduled encrypted backups, WAL archiving for point-in-time recovery, and documented drills. `npm run db:backup`, `npm run db:restore` and `npm run backup:health-check` in `backend/`. [BACKUP.md](./BACKUP.md), [DISASTER_RECOVERY.md](./DISASTER_RECOVERY.md)
- **Monitoring**: Sentry, Prometheus metrics, structured Winston logs, liveness and readiness probes, and Grafana with Loki and Promtail. [MONITORING.md](./MONITORING.md), [LOGGING.md](./LOGGING.md)
- **Privacy**: consent-gated dashboard analytics and data controls. [PRIVACY_ANALYTICS.md](./PRIVACY_ANALYTICS.md)
